I trawled through data from a lot of places, but liked these:

https://app.namara.io/#/organizations/5e7e1e40be428d1fd2318192/projects
https://github.com/namara-io/namara-python
https://systems.jhu.edu/research/public-health/ncov/ 
https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19 
https://covid19api.com/
https://worldpopulationreview.com/states/

Also pulled a PDF from CDC, and used online tool to extract needed pages, and parse to Excel.
Then a little bit of data cleanup.
Combined all into 'Combined.csv'

Output to 'samplemap.html' a simple interactive Map.
Hoverover a State to see details.

This is as far as I got :(
